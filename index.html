      <p>Port Washington, Wisconsin</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I love to travel, but when I can't be wandering around a new city I like trying new restaurants and craft beers. You can also find me most Sundays near Netflix and a puzzle.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>My dream job is one that could be done from anywhere in the world. I'm hoping I can find an opportunity in web development that allows that flexibility!</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>Seattle, Washington</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>Every company depends on people with the skills I will learn in this course. I am excited to contribute in new ways in my current role, but also look forward to the new opportunities this will present to me.</p>
